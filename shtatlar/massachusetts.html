  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Massachusetts (/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsɪts/ (About this soundlisten), /-zɪts/), officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,[a] is the most populous state in the New England region of the United States. It borders on the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Connecticut to the southwest and Rhode Island to the southeast, New Hampshire to the northeast, Vermont to the northwest, and New York to the west. The capital of Massachusetts is Boston, which is also the most populous city in New England. It is home to the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry.[45] Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade,[46] Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution.[47] During the 20th century, Massachusetts's economy shifted from manufacturing to services.[48] Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.[49]

    Massachusetts was a site of early English colonization: the Plymouth Colony was founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, and in 1630 the Massachusetts Bay Colony, taking its name from the indigenous Massachusett, established settlements in Boston and Salem. In 1692, the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem witch trials.[50] In 1777, General Henry Knox founded the Springfield Armory, which, during the Industrial Revolution, catalyzed numerous important technological advances, including interchangeable parts.[51] In 1786, Shays' Rebellion, a populist revolt led by disaffected American Revolutionary War veterans, influenced the United States Constitutional Convention.[52] In the 18th century, the Protestant First Great Awakening, which swept Britain and the Thirteen Colonies, originated from the pulpit of Northampton preacher Jonathan Edwards.[53] In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the "Cradle of Liberty"[54] for the agitation there that later led to the American Revolution.</p>
